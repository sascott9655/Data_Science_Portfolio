## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Question 1 : Without using the multiplication operator (*), write ## a multiplication script that takes two
## numbers as input and outputs the product using either a “for” loop ## or a “while” loop.
## Show your script. 

mult = function(x,y) {
count = 0
	for (i in 1:x) {
	  for (j in 1:y) {
		if(j <= y) {
		  count = count + 1
		}
		j = j + 1
	  }
	 i = i + 1
	}
	return (count)
}

##2. Using the customers data (custdata.tsv). Like histogram, you can also plot the density of
##a variable.
##2.1: Figure out how to plot density of income. (5 points)

cust <- read.csv('C:/Users/samsc/Desktop/ADS-500B/Data_and_Code2/custdata.tsv', header=T, sep='\t')
cust

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cust, aes(x=income)) + geom_density(fill='blue') +
scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(accuracy = 0.01)) +
labs(title = "Density plot for income",
      x ="Income",
      y ="Density")
#used gemini to help scale x values to readabale using scale_x_continuous

###2.2: Provide a couple of sentences of description along with the plot. Imagine you
##are explaining this to your manager or a senior leader

The density plot for income shows that most of the customers do not make over 6 figures or 100 thousand dollars in income. The density plot peak is near the beginning of the data set, which means that there is a positive right skew in our dataset. I would change the x-axis values to be smaller in value for the customer data set to capture more of the observations.
